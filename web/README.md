Setting up the Project
Firstly, you have to install node_modules by running
```npm install```

To start local server, run the next command
```npm run start```

Then you'll have your admin panel web UI up and running.
Here you can see the list of contacts, with main fields shown.
After clicking the Edit Contact button, the dialog window will be opened.
There you could find all of the contact fields displayed, including
image, color etc. Here you can edit contact and save your changes by clicking
Submit button. Or click Cancel to just close the modal.
Also, you can create new contact by clicking the menu icon on the right
of the top bar and choosing Create Contact. Then Create Account modal will be opened.
FIY, there aren't any validations on the forms now, so you could submit user creation even
with all empty fields.
